# CSC-340-Project YouSell

## Hunter Mitchell, Steven Torres, and Logan Christian

##Our app will provide a platform for anyone and everyone to buy and sell used and new items. Our app offers a great opportunity for people trying to get rid of unused items or make a profit on something theyâ€™ve made or manufactured. This app will make it easier for people to find great deals on items they may have never thought of getting/needing. We aim to provide plenty of user friendly features including but not limited to direct messaging and a review panel. We also strive to implement a block/report feature, so that users can report suspicious or inappropriate behaviors by customers or providers, this way admins are able to see this kind of behavior and make any appropriate actions.

## Running the program
To run this program you will need to ensure that you have the "mvc_app_db" in your MySQL. Simply just run the DemoApplication Java program. A default account with the Username:user and Password: user is there but you are encouraged to create your own account to see the functionality of it. After Logging in you should have access to all features within our program.
